## About

This is a simple application that lets you view a list of users and then view their posts by clicking on a user. I chose to use React since I am comfortable using it, and prefer it over Vanilla JS. I hope you enjoy!

## Installation
1. Clone Repo.
    ```sh
    https://github.com/erikamanning/ksense-coding-challenge.git
    ```
2. Install packages.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the app!
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Thanks!
I know you guys must have a ton of application to go through. I just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to look at mine! Good luck in the search.
